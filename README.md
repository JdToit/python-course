# Introduction to Python

Prerequisits: 

Python is a programming used for web programming, data science, artificial intelligence, and many other scientific applications.
In order to start using Python, you need to have an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) downloaded. There are many different
ones, such as PyCharm, VSCode, IDLE, Spyder, just to name a few. 

# Python Essentials

I have been studying Python for approximately 4 months now and I am enjoying it a lot.
